	abstract = {Although single-cell RNA sequencing studies have begun to provide compendia of cell expression profiles1–9, it has been difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

Here, we identify transient overexpression of the transcription factor (TF) NKX2-1 as a powerful inductive signal for the robust derivation of thyrocyte-like cells from mouse PSC-derived AFE. This effect is highly developmental stage specific and dependent on FOXA2 expression levels and precise modulation of BMP and FGF signaling. The majority of the resulting cells express thyroid TFs (Nkx2-1, Pax8, Foxe1, Hhex) and thyroid hormone synthesis-related genes (Tg, Tpo, Nis, Iyd) at levels similar to adult mouse thyroid and give rise to functional follicle-like epithelial structures in Matrigel culture. Our findings demonstrate that NKX2-1 overexpression converts AFE to thyroid epithelium in a developmental time-sensitive manner and suggest a general methodology for manipulation of cell-fate decisions of developmental intermediates.},

              Biologists have long attempted to understand how stem and progenitor cells in regenerating and embryonic tissues differentiate into mature cell types. Through the use of recent technical advances to sequence the genes expressed in thousands of individual cells, differentiation mechanisms are being revealed. Weinreb

              extended these methods to track clones of cells (cell families) across time. Their approach reveals differences in cellular gene expression as cells progress through hematopoiesis, which is the process of blood production. Using machine learning, they tested how well gene expression measurements account for the choices that cells make. This work reveals that a considerable gap still exists in understanding differentiation mechanisms, and future methods are needed to fully understand—and ultimately control—cell differentiation.

              INTRODUCTION 
              During tissue turnover, stem and progenitor cells differentiate to produce mature cell types. To understand and ultimately control differentiation, it is important to establish how initial differences between cells influence their ultimate choice of cell fate. This challenge is exemplified in hematopoiesis, the ongoing process of blood regeneration in bone marrow, in which multipotent progenitors give rise to red cells of the blood, as well as myeloid and lymphoid immune cell types. 
              In hematopoiesis, progenitor cell states have been canonically defined by their expression of several antigens. However, as in several other tissues, recent transcriptome analysis by single-cell RNA sequencing (scSeq) showed that the canonically defined intermediate cell types are not uniform, but rather contain cells in a variety of gene expression states. scSeq also showed that the states of hematopoietic progenitors form a continuum, differing from classic depictions of a discrete stepwise hierarchy. 
             
             
              RATIONALE 
              In this study, we set out to establish how variation in transcriptional state biases future cell fate and whether scSeq is sufficient to completely distinguish cells with distinct fate biases. Directly linking whole-transcriptome descriptions of cells to their future fate is challenging because cells are destroyed during scSeq measurement. We therefore developed a tool we call LARRY (lineage and RNA recovery) that clonally tags cells with DNA barcodes that can be read using scSeq. Using LARRY, we aimed to reconstruct the genome-wide transcriptional trajectories of cells as they differentiate. 
             
             
              RESULTS 
              We linked transcriptional progenitor states with their clonal fates by barcoding heterogeneous cells, allowing cell division, and then sampling cells for scSeq immediately or at later time points after differentiation in culture or in transplanted mice. We profiled {\textgreater}300,000 cells in total, comprising 10,968 clones that gave information on lineage relationships at single time points and 2632 clones spanning multiple time points in culture or in mice. We confirmed that clonal trajectories over time approximated the trajectories of single cells and were thus able to identify states of primed fate potential on the continuous transcriptional landscape. From this analysis, we identified genes correlating with fate, established a lineage hierarchy for hematopoiesis in culture and after transplantation, and revealed two routes of monocyte differentiation that give rise to distinct gene expression programs in mature cells. The data made it possible to test state-of the-art algorithms of scSeq analysis, and we found that fate choice occurs earlier than predicted algorithmically but that computationally predicted pseudotime orderings faithfully describe clonal dynamics. 
              We investigated whether there are stable cellular properties that have a cell-autonomous influence on fate choice yet are not detected by scSeq. By analyzing clones split between wells or transplanted into separate mice, we found that the variance in cell fate choice attributable to cell-autonomous fate bias was greater than what could be explained by initial transcriptional state. Less formally, sister cells tended to be far more similar in their fate choice than pairs of cells with similar transcriptomes. These results suggest that current scSeq measurements cannot fully separate progenitor cells with distinct fate bias. The missing signature of future fate choice might be detectable in the RNA that is not sampled during scSeq. Alternatively, other stable cellular properties such as chromatin state could encode the missing information. 
             
             
              CONCLUSION 
              By integrating transcriptome and lineage measurements, we established a map of clonal fate on a continuous transcriptional landscape. The map revealed transcriptional correlates of fate among putatively multipotent cells, convergent differentiation trajectories, and fate boundaries that could be not be predicted using current trajectory inference methods. However, the map is far from complete because scSeq cannot separate cells with distinct fate bias. Our results argue for looking beyond scSeq to define cellular maps of stem and progenitor cells and offer an approach for linking cell state and fate in other tissues. 
               
                 
                  Lineage and transcriptome measurements allow fate mapping on continuous cell state landscapes. 
                  A tool we named LARRY labels cell clones with an scSeq-compatible barcode. By barcoding cells, letting them divide, and then sampling them immediately or after differentiation, it is possible to link the initial states of cells with their differentiation outcomes and produce a map of cell fate bias on a continuous transcriptional landscape. 
                 
                 
               
             
          ,  
            A challenge in biology is to associate molecular differences among progenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cell types. Here, we used expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace transcriptomes over time and applied this to study fate determination in hematopoiesis. We identified states of primed fate potential and located them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We identified two routes of monocyte differentiation that leave an imprint on mature cells. Analysis of sister cells also revealed cells to have intrinsic fate biases not detectable by single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, we benchmarked computational methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, showing that fate choice occurs earlier than is detected by state-of the-art algorithms and that cells progress steadily through pseudotime with precise and consistent dynamics.},

            Lung organogenesis requires precise timing and coordination to effect spatial organization and function of the parenchymal cells. To provide a systematic broad-based view of the mechanisms governing the dynamic alterations in parenchymal cells over crucial periods of development, we performed a single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series yielding 102,571 epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across nine time points from embryonic day 12 to postnatal day 14 in mice. Combining computational fate-likelihood prediction with RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, we explore lineage relationships during the saccular to alveolar stage transition. The utility of this publicly searchable atlas resource (www.sucrelab.org/lungcells) is exemplified by discoveries of the complexity of type 1 pneumocyte function and characterization of mesenchymal Wnt expression patterns during the saccular and alveolar stages – wherein major expansion of the gas-exchange surface occurs. We provide an integrated view of cellular dynamics in epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cell populations during lung organogenesis.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
          Durable reconstitution of the injured distal lung epithelium with pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derivatives, if realized, would represent a promising potential therapy for diseases that result from alveolar damage. Here we differentiate murine PSCs in vitro into self-renewing lung epithelial progenitors able to engraft into the injured distal lung epithelium of immunocompetent, syngeneic mouse recipients. Emulating the roadmap of the developing embryo, we generate transplantable PSC-derived Nkx2-1+/Sox9+ lung epithelial progenitors that are highly similar to cultured primary embryonic distal lung bud tip progenitors. These cells display a stable phenotype after frozen archiving or extensive expansion in culture, providing a nearly inexhaustible source of cells that can be engrafted into syngeneic injured mouse lungs without the need for immunosuppression. After transplantation PSC-derived tip-like progenitors downregulate Sox9 and mature in the distal lung, upregulating alveolar type 2 cell markers or assuming the flat morphology and molecular phenotype of terminally differentiated alveolar type 1 cells. After months in vivo, donor-derived cells retain their alveolar epithelial type 2-like and type 1-like phenotypes, as characterized by single cell RNA sequencing, ultrastructural analyses, in vivo histologic profiling, and ex vivo organoid assays that demonstrate continued capacity of the engrafted cells to proliferate and differentiate. These results indicate durable reconstitution of the distal lung’s facultative progenitor and differentiated epithelial cell compartments in vivo with PSC-derived cells, thus establishing a novel model for pulmonary cell therapy which can be utilized to better understand the mechanisms and utility of engraftment prior to future clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Trajectory inference approaches analyze genome-wide omics data from thousands of single cells and computationally infer the order of these cells along developmental trajectories. Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline (https://benchmark.dynverse.org) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.},

PAGA maps preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions, and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow. We demonstrate the method by inferring structure-rich cell maps with consistent topology across four hematopoietic datasets, adult planaria and the zebrafish embryo and benchmark computational performance on one million neurons.},

	abstract = {A common metaphor for describing development is a rugged “epigenetic landscape” where cell fates are represented as attracting valleys resulting from a complex regulatory network. Here, we introduce a framework for explicitly constructing epigenetic landscapes that combines genomic data with techniques from spin-glass physics. Each cell fate is a dynamic attractor, yet cells can change fate in response to external signals. Our model suggests that partially reprogrammed cells are a natural consequence of high-dimensional landscapes, and predicts that partially reprogrammed cells should be hybrids that co-express genes from multiple cell fates. We verify this prediction by reanalyzing existing datasets. Our model reproduces known reprogramming protocols and identifies candidate transcription factors for reprogramming to novel cell fates, suggesting epigenetic landscapes are a powerful paradigm for understanding cellular identity.},

	abstract = {The generation of cellular diversity during development involves differentiating cells transitioning between discrete cell states. In the 1940s, the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington introduced a landscape metaphor to describe this process. The developmental path of a cell was pictured as a ball rolling through a terrain of branching valleys with cell fate decisions represented by the branch points at which the ball decides between one of two available valleys. Here we discuss progress in constructing quantitative dynamical models inspired by this view of cellular differentiation. We describe a framework based on catastrophe theory and dynamical systems methods that provides the foundations for quantitative geometric models of cellular differentiation. These models can be fit to experimental data and used to make quantitative predictions about cellular differentiation. The theory indicates that cell fate decisions can be described by a small number of decision structures, such that there are only two distinct ways in which cells make a binary choice between one of two fates. We discuss the biological relevance of these mechanisms and suggest the approach is broadly applicable for the quantitative analysis of differentiation dynamics and for determining principles of developmental decisions.},
